# Learning Java from Scratch

This repository documents my journey of learning Java from scratch. I'll be posting my learning progress, code samples, and projects related to Java programming in this repository.

## Progress Log

### Day 1: Introduction to Java
- Installed Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Set up Visual Studio Code for Java development
- Wrote my first "Hello World" program

### Day 2: Basics of Java Syntax
- Learned about variables, data types, and operators
- Explored how to take user input using `Scanner` class
- Practiced basic arithmetic and logical operations

### Day 3: Control Flow
- Understood `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements
- Learned about `switch` statements for multi-choice scenarios
- Explored looping with `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops

### Day 4: Functions and Methods
- Created my own methods and functions
- Explored method parameters and return values
- Understood method overloading and visibility modifiers

### Day 5: Arrays and Lists
- Learned about arrays and their initialization
- Explored Java's built-in `ArrayList` class
- Practiced common array manipulation techniques

### Day 6: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics
- Introduced to classes and objects
- Explored constructors, instance variables, and methods
- Understood the concepts of encapsulation and abstraction

## Projects

### Project 1: Simple Calculator
- Created a basic calculator program using control flow and functions
- Implemented addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- Took user input and displayed results

### Project 2: To-Do List Application
- Developed a console-based to-do list application
- Utilized arrays or lists to manage tasks
- Implemented functionalities like adding, deleting, and listing tasks

## Goals

My primary goals for this learning journey are to:
- Gain a solid understanding of Java programming language fundamentals.
- Develop proficiency in object-oriented programming concepts.
- Build practical projects that showcase my learning progress.

Feel free to explore the code and projects in this repository. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

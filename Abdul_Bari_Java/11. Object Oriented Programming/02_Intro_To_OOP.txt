Principles of the OOP:
    * Absraction:
        Hiding the internal implemenation and showing only required features.
        Ex: Car, Tv

    * Encapsulation
        Wrapping up the data and function of the object into the single unit to protect it from the external modification
        EX: Bank Account, Blockchain

    * Inheritence (Spcilization)
        Inheritance means creating new classes based on existing ones. A class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and fields of that class. In addition, you can add new fields and methods to your current class as well.  
        Ex: 
            Iphone 15 is the inherits from iphone 14, it has also the features of 14 and some extra features in it.

    * Polymorhpism ( Generalization)
        Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance
        Ex: 
            Tv could be of Sumsung, lG
            Phone could be of sumsung, iphone,vivo
            Car Could be of Toyta, Suzuki etc
